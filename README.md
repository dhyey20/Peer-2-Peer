# Peer-2-Peer

##Objectives
In this project, you will implement a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) system with a centralized index (CI). Although this
P2P-CI system is rather elementary, in the process I expect that you will develop a good understanding of P2P and
client-server systems and build a number of fundamental skills related to writing Internet applications, including:
• becoming familiar with network programming and the socket interface,
• creating server processes that wait for connections,
• creating client processes that contact a well-known server and exchange data over the Internet,
• defining a simple application protocol and making sure that peers and server follow precisely the
specifications for their side of the protocol in order to accomplish particular tasks,
• creating and managing a centralized index at the server based on information provided by the peers, and
• implementing a concurrent server that is capable of carrying out communication with multiple clients
simultaneously.
